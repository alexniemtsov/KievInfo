# KievInfo
Plugin: weather and exchange rates.

Developed for php 7

"Kiev" folder: basic plugin to work with the API. Setting via: Extensions - Plugins - Kiev information plugin
"mod_weather": module to display content from a plug.

There were two options: Plugin.Content addition or creation of an additional group of plug-ins. I chose the second option, but we can implement by using Plugin/Events/Content/
